# Contributing to Multinest Media Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

Multinest Media maintains a range of projects with different goals, maturity levels,
and contribution policies. Please read this document carefully before engaging.

---

## Contribution Eligibility

Only repositories that explicitly welcome contributions are open to external input.

Eligible repositories will typically include:
- A public `LICENSE`
- Open GitHub Issues
- Clear contribution notes in the repository README

Repositories without these indicators should be considered internal or closed-source.

---

## Getting Started

Before submitting a contribution:

1. Read the repository README thoroughly
2. Check existing issues and pull requests
3. Open a discussion or issue if the change is non-trivial

Unsolicited large changes are unlikely to be accepted without prior discussion.

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing, please ensure that:

- Code follows the existing style and structure
- Changes are scoped and purposeful
- Commits are clear and descriptive
- Documentation is updated where relevant
- Tests are added or updated when appropriate

Quality, clarity, and maintainability are prioritized over speed.

---

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should:
- Reference an existing issue or discussion when applicable
- Clearly describe *what* changed and *why*
- Avoid unrelated or bundled changes

Maintainers may request revisions or decline contributions that do not
align with the project’s direction or standards.

---

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to engage respectfully and professionally.

Harassment, abuse, or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.
Maintainers reserve the right to moderate or close contributions
that violate these expectations.

---

## Licensing

By submitting a contribution, you agree that your work may be used
under the same license as the repository to which you are contributing.

If a repository does not specify a license, contributions will not be accepted.

---

## Questions

If you are unsure whether a contribution is appropriate,
please open a discussion or contact the maintainers listed
in the repository documentation.
